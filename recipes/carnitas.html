    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>These Mexican carnitas may take a little longer to make, but the steps are very simple. We’re talking fried pork… crispy outside, tender and flavorful inside. When shredded and stuffed inside a taco with onion, cilantro and a squeeze of lime, it’s simply THE BEST.</p>
    <h3>Recipe Notes:</h3>
    <h4>How to serve authentic carnitas</h4>
        <p>Because the meat is so tender and flavorful, you’ll be tempted to eat it straight off the plate!
            <ul>
                <li>
                    corn or flour torillas
                </li>
                <li>
                    refried beans
                </li>
                <li>
                    white onions, sliced
                </li>
                <li>
                    fresh cilantro, chopped
                </li>
                <li>
                    limes, sliced for squeezing over everything
                </li>
            </ul>       
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most important steps is to dry brine the meat overnight. Doing this allows the salt to penetrate deep into the meat and lock in the moisture. 
            <br> 
            Simply rub kosher salt over all of the pork pieces and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 12 hours.
        </p>
    <h4>How are authentic carnitas traditionally made?</h4>
        <p>The Spanish word carnitas in English means “little meats”. Traditionally, an authentic carnitas recipe is made by braising or simmering pork shoulder (pork butt) in lard or oil until tender.</p>
    <h4>Cooking the meat</h4>
        <p>
            Before you get started, remove the meat from the refrigerator and let it rest on the counter.
            <br>
            Bringing the meat to room temperature first helps it cook more evenly. It also keeps the meat from seizing when added to the hot lard, which would prevent it from being melt-in-your-mouth tender.
        </p>
    <h4>Finishing the pork carnitas</h4>
        <p>
            After the initial cook is done, add the milk. It will boil initially, but don’t let it continue to boil. Doing so will cause it to sour and curdle.
            <br>
            Watch the temperature during the final cooking process. The meat needs to continue to simmer, but don’t let it come back to a boil.
            <br>
            Let the pork shoulder cool before shredding. If you shred the meat when it’s still hot, the juices will escape and you’ll be left with dry carnitas.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <p>
            <h5>SEASONING BUNDLE</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>▢6 garlic cloves</li>
                <li>1/2 orange</li>
                <li>1/2 onion</li>
                <li>3 bay leaves</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Mexican oregano</li>
                <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>Note: Mexican oregano is a relative of Lemon Verbena and is native to Mexico. Similar in that it’s pungent like Mediterranean oregano, Mexican oregano has notes of mild licorice and citrus. Mediterranean oregano is a member of the mint family and most often is used in Greek and Italian recipes. Mediterranean oregano is the one most found in spice racks and supermarkets.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>CARNITAS</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>6 lbs boneless pork shoulder (pork butt), cut into 3-inch chunks</li>
                <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>FRYING</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>4 lbs pork lard</li>
                <li>2 oz Piloncillo or brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
                <li>Note: I buy ARMOUR Manteca/Lard in a 4 pound tub found near the butcher/meat section at my local market. Remember to boil and keep at 350°F. Do not exceed 365-370°F, which is the smoking point of lard.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p>
            <h5>PREPARE</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Rub the kosher salt over pork. Place in a sealed container and refrigerate over night.</li>
                <li>Remove pork from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature.</li>
                <li>In a large piece of cheesecloth, wrap the garlic cloves, orange, onion, bay leaves, Mexican oregano and cinnamon stick and secure with kitchen twine.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>FRYING</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt the lard in a large, heavy stock pot over high heat. Carefully add the Seasoning Bundle, piloncillo (or brown sugar) and pork chunks.</li>
                <li>Bring lard to a boil over high heat (350°F), lower to medium (adjust heat to medium low if pork turns brown too quickly) and cook, stirring often, for 90 minutes. Pork will turn a golden brown. Do not exceed to 370°F which is the smoking point of lard.</li>
                <li>Turn heat to low and carefully add the milk. Stir and it will boil slightly for 30 seconds. Simmer for 20-30 minutes until meat is fall apart tender when gently squeezed with tongs or fork.</li>
                <li>Carefully transfer pork from oil using a slotted spoon or spider to a serving platter lined with paper towels. Allow meat to cool slightly and shred by hand or using forks.</li>
                <li>Serve with hot tortillas, refried beans, sliced onions, tomato slices, cilantro, limes and salsas of choice.</li>
            </ol>
