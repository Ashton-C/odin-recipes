    <p>Learn how to make sushi rice at home that turns out perfect every single time! You are only a few steps away from perfect sushi rice and, thus, delicious homemade sushi rolls!</p>
    <h3>Recipe Notes:</h3>
    <h4>Rice Cooker vs Stovetop</h4>
        <p>If you are inexperienced with cooking sushi rice, I highly recommend using the rice cooker method! It’s easier than the stovetop method and leaves less room for error.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Be aware that the rice-water ratio is different for both methods:
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rice Cooker Ratio: 1:1.25 → 1 Cup of Rice + 1.25 Cups of Water
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pot Ratio: 1:1.1 → 1 Cup of Rice + 1.1 Cups of Water
                </li>
            </ul>       
        </p>
        <p>Note: 1 ½ cups (300g) uncooked rice is enough for about 4-5 thick California rolls or 7-8 medium Maki rolls. Depending on your appetite, this is enough for 2-4 people.</p>
    <h4>Best Rice For Sushi</h4>
        <p>
            Short-grain white Japanese rice or medium-grain Californian rice is the one you are looking for if you wish to get that typical soft yet sticky sushi rice texture. Outside of Japan, the bag is usually labeled with “sushi rice”. You can get it in your local grocery store within the Asian aisle or in a dedicated Asian shop. Later offers large bags at a more affordable price.
            <br>
            Keep your hands off all other types of rice! It doesn’t work with basmati or jasmine rice.
        </p>
    <h4>Sushi Vinegar Seasoning</h4>
        <p>
            Sushi rice has a slightly sweet-sour aroma that comes from a seasoning mixture made with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Those three ingredients are cooked in a saucepan, and as soon as the sugar is fully dissolved, it’s poured over the cooked rice for its dedicated flavor.
            <br>
            I recommend preparing the sushi vinegar seasoning at home. Ready-to-use mixtures, labeled as sushi vinegar, are available at almost any grocery store. However, those never taste as good as the homemade version.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <p>
            <h5>Rice</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups (300 g) sushi rice</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups + 1 tbsp (375 ml) water (if using the rice cooker method) <sub>1 ⅜ cups (330ml) water if using the stovetop method</sub></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Sushi Vinegar</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup (60 ml) rice vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p>
            <h5>Prepare</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><i>Rinse Rice:</i> Place the sushi rice in a large bowl and wash the rice under running cold water until the water runs clear. → Move the rice in a circular rotation using your hand to speed up this process.</li>
                <li><i>Drain Rice:</i>Carefully discard the water (use a sieve if you want)</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Cook Sushi Rice in a Rice Cooker</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Place washed rice with 1 ½ cups + 1 tbsp (375ml) water in the bowl of a rice cooker. Let the rice soak for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Start cooking. Use the "sushi rice" method if your rice cooker has that option.</li>
                <li>Spread 1 stick softened butter over dough. Combine both sugars and the cinnamon for the filling in a small bowl. Evenly sprinkle over butter.</li>
                <li>Once the rice is cooked, switch off the rice cooker and leave the rice to sit for another 10-15 minutes in the rice cooker. DO NOT OPEN THE LID!</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Cook Sushi Rice in a Pot</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Place washed rice with 1 ⅜ cups (330ml) water in a pot. Let the rice soak for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>With the lid on, bring the pot to a boil. Reduce the heat to the minimum and let it cook for 8 minutes. → Do not open the lid while cooking!</li>
                <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let the rice sit for another 10-15 minutes with the lid on.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Make Sushi Vinegar and Serve</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Meanwhile, add rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, switch off the heat, and stir until the sugar dissolves.</li>
                <li>Season Rice: Place cooked rice in a large bowl, pour over the hot vinegar mixture, and toss until well combined.</li>
                <li>Cool: Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel to prevent the sushi rice from drying out. Let it cool on the counter until it reaches room temperature.</li>
                <li>Serve: Use the rice to make your favorite sushi recipe or delicious poke bowls.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Storage</h5>
            <p>Always use freshly cooked sushi rice to make sushi! Once refrigerated, it will turn hard and is no longer usable to make sushi. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days and used to make poke bowls or fried rice.</p>
