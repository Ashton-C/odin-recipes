    <h3>Recipe Notes:</h3>
    <h4>Timing of rise</h4>
        <p>The exact timing will depend on many factors, including:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    your room temperature (cooler room = slower rise)
                </li>
                <li>
                    your bowl (really! ceramic bowls are warmer, so if you want your dough to rise faster, donâ€™t leave it in your mixerâ€™s stainless steel bowl)
                </li>
                <li>
                    your altitude (higher altitude = faster rise)
                </li>
                <li>
                    your yeast (instant yeast = fast rise; active yeast = regular rise; organic yeast = slow rise)
                </li>
            </ul>       
        </p>
        <p>Note: This stage can also be done in the fridge overnight! Just make sure to remove the dough from the fridge 15-30 minutes before continuing with the recipe, so it can warm up.</p>
    <h4>Cutting</h4>
        <p>Use a bread knife or sewing thread.</p>
    <h4>Baking</h4>
        <p>
            Cinnamon rolls are supposed to be soft and a bit gooey, so donâ€™t overbake them â€“ theyâ€™ll be dry.
            <br>
            Itâ€™s perfectly fine if they turn a light golden on top, but they shouldnâ€™t turn out crispy and dark brown on top.
            <br>
            Be sure to watch them like a hawk! No shame in hanging out in front of your oven just to get that perfect batch of homemade cinnamon rolls ðŸ™‚

                <li>4 cups all-purpose flour plus up to Â½ cup more as needed</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons butter diced and softened</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Filling</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1 stick butter softened</li>
                <li>Â½ cup brown sugar packed</li>
                <li>Â½ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Easy cream cheese frosting</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Â¾ cup cream cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup icing sugar or more to taste</li>
                <li>Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>pinch salt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p>
            <h5>Make the dough</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Warm milk to around 100Â°F. This will take 30-45 seconds in the microwave â€“ do not use milk that is hotter than 105Â°F, or you will destroy the yeast!</li>
                <li>Place yeast in small bowl with 1 tablespoon warm milk and 1 teaspoon granulated sugar. Stir, then let sit for 5 minutes, until bubbles appear on the surface.</li>
                <li>Place flour, butter, salt, eggs, yeast mixture, remaining milk and sugar in the bowl of your stand mixer. Stir a little to roughly combine.</li>
                <li>Knead dough in the mixer with the dough hook attached on medium speed until dough forms a ball. Dough should be completely smooth. If dough doesn't form a ball: Add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time with the mixer running on low speed, until dough pulls together (do not add too much flour, or dough will have a biscuit-like texture). Kneading can take around 10-12 minutes, so be patient.</li>
                <li>Turn dough out into a greased bowl. Shape into a ball, pinching the bottom to form a smooth surface. Place it seam down, then cover with a clean tea towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Shape the cinnamon rolls</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Dust work surface with flour. Turn out dough on floured surface, punch down and shape into a rectangle.</li>
                <li>Roll dough into rectangle, about 18Ã—12 inches. Dough should be around Â¼ inch thick.</li>
                <li>Spread 1 stick softened butter over dough. Combine both sugars and the cinnamon for the filling in a small bowl. Evenly sprinkle over butter.</li>
                <li>Roll up into a log from the longer side and pinch the seam to seal. Place log seam-side down. Slice into 12 rolls (I use a piece of sewing thread or dental floss for neat rolls).</li>
                <li>Place rolls in greased 9Ã—13 inch pan. Cover with the tea towel and let sit until puffy and almost doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Bake cinnamon rolls</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>As rolls rise, heat oven to 350Â°F.</li>
                <li>Bake risen rolls in the hot oven until lightly golden brown. This takes around 18 minutes. Be sure to check the rolls often. If center rolls aren't baked after 20 minutes, tent pan with aluminum foil and continue baking for up to 15-20 extra minutes (this can happen if your room was cool and the dough is colder due to it).
                    Frost rolls</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Frost rolls</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Place ingredients for the frosting in a medium mixing bowl. Beat with a hand mixer until smooth.</li>
                <li>Once cinnamon rolls are done, remove pan form oven and place on a wire rack. Let sit for 5 minutes, then frost rolls while warm.</li>
                <li>Let cinnamon rolls cool until they can be touched, then serve warm.</li>
            </ol>
